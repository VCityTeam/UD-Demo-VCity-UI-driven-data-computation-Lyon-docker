<VirtualHost *:80>
  # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
  # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
  # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
  # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
  # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
  # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
  # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
  ### Customized section
  # Yet in the context of a docker container, the ServerName is unknown
  # at build stage and hence using the ServerName directive would be
  # impossible/pointless. Instead the ServerName will be set out of the
  # hostname which in case of a container can be set with the "-h" flag
  # of the "docker run" command
  # ServerName <left_unset>
  #    ServerAlias www.<left_unset>
